This paper describe the latest results of ATLAS b-jet identification performance and efficiency measurement with ttar events.

- The identification of jets containing b-hadrons (b-jets) against the large jet background containing c-hadrons but no b-hadron (c-jets) or containing neither b- or c-hadrons (light-flavour jets) is of major importance in many areas of the physics programme of the ATLAS experiment, plays a crucial role in a large number of Standard Model (SM) precision measurements, studies of the Higgs boson properties, and searches for new phenomena.

- The most impoartant feature of b-jet is that it contains a b hadron which has a long life time, with the help of inner detector of ATLAS, we can reconstruct the secondary vertex of the b-badron.

- Several algorithms have been developed to identify the b-jet:
-- Low-level identifications
### IP2D, only utilizing the transverse impact parameter
### IP3D, utilize both transverse and longitudinal impact parameters
### SV1, based on the secondary vertex(vertex mass, energy fraction and the number of two-track vertices)
### JetFitter: reconstruct the topological structure of the full b-hadron decay chain
## High-level b-jet identification(outputs from low-level algorithms as inputs)
### MV2: MVA method based on BDT, BDT score as the discriminant
### DL1, a deep feed-forward neural network.
