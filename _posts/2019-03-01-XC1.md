Welcome to the first issue of X Courier! 

Influncex by the [CERN Courier](cerncourier.com), we choose the _courier_ as our monthly news summary of X-Team. The main goal is to report the progress has been made in the past and collect upcoming meetings and conferences. We hope the _courier_ will sever as a growing dairy for our team and userful resources whenever possible. 


## Publications

* [arXiv:1810.09037](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09037) "Precision Higgs Physics at CEPC" submitted to the [Chinese Physics C](http://iopscience.iop.org/journal/1674-1137). Congratulations to Maoqiang and Ryuta for your hard work on Higgs invisible and ZZ decay analysis! 

* [arXiv:1901.10283] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10283) "Characterization of the first prototype CMOS pixel sensor developed for the CEPC vertex detector" submitted to [Radiation Detection Technology and Methods]https://link.springer.com/journal/41605). Cogratulations to Ryuta for your contribution on develping the FPGA firmware to make the DAQ possible. Sorry that the paper could not list all the contributers, I would like to thank for Tao, Maoqiang, Hao, Yaoyao, Xiaoxu, Xudong, and Jason for your contributions!
