The precise measurement of the mass  and  resonance width of 
the Z boson, which are two most fundamental parameters,
 plays important role in testing the standard model.

In the electron positron collider, the precise measurements preformed by fitting 
to the visible cross sections as a function of the centre-of-mass energy, 
which requires a precise knowledge of the beam energies with a precision of 20 ppm.

At this level, the effects of terrestrial tides must be taken into account, 
as introduced in the selected JC paper.

Although not discussed in the paper, there are also other effects 
 that not negligible. First, the change in circumference correlates with the 
rainfall and lake level seasonally; second, there is electrical noise that caused 
by the departure of high speed train to Paris.

For the next generation electron-positron collider working as a Z factory, 
these effects must be taken into accounts.
