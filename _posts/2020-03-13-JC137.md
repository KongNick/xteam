This paper describe the study of point- and cluster-defects in radiation-damaged silicon. This is the summary:
- A new method of analysing TSC (Thermally Stimulated Current) spectra of radiation-damaged silicon diodes.
- An ionisation energy, 𝐸𝑎, which depends on 𝑓𝑡, the fraction of filled point defects in the cluster, is introduced.
- As a first step the VO𝑖 defect) is analysed for the diode irradiated by 27 MeV electrons The value found for 𝛥𝐸𝑎 is compatible with zero. This confirms that VO𝑖 is a point defect, and also demonstrates the validity of the method for point defects.
- The radiation-induced deep acceptor states with energies bettween 0.35 and 0.46 eV from the conduction band are investigated. 
- To study the dependence of the cluster formation on electron energy, the data for 𝐸𝑒 = 3.5, 6, 15, and 27 MeV after annealing for 30 min at 80 ◦C are analysed.
- To study the annealing of the clusters, the data for the irradiation with 15 MeV electrons and the conditions as irradiated and after isochronal annealing for 30 min between 𝑇𝑎𝑛𝑛 = 80− 280 ◦C are analysed.
- The result is than using a model the 𝑇𝑎𝑛𝑛 dependence of the diffusion parameters and of the spatial spread of the point defects in the cluster is estimated.
