title: Jpsi invisible decay 
---

J/psi invisible analysis. 

An invisible particle decay mode is defined as one where the final particles 
interact so weakly that there are no observables in general purpose particle detectors. 
Invisible decays of quarkonia such as $\jpsi$, $\Upsilon$, etc., and other mesons
provide a window on physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). This is because the 
only allowed invisible decay of quarkonium states in the SM is the decay to $\nu\bar{\nu}$
via annihilation into a virtual $Z^0$ boson. If the invisible decay rate is observed
to have a larger branching fraction than the SM prediction, it implies physics
beyond the SM. Invisible decays of some other particles have be studied.

Using $14.0\times10^6$ $\psip$ events, the BESII experiment obtained a first upper 
limit, $\mathcal{B}(\jpsi\to{\rm invisible})/\mathcal{B}(\jpsi\to\mu^+\mu^-)<1.2\times10^{-2}$,
corresponding to $\mathcal{B}(\jpsi\to{\rm invisible})<7\times10^{-4}$ 
via the $\psip\to\pip\pim\jpsi$ transition. We present here updated results 
of search for the invisible decay of the $\jpsi$. The data sample used consists of 
$(106.41\pm0.86)\times10^6$ $\psip$ events collected with the BESIII detector
at the BEPCII collider~\cite{BEPCII}.
